Autopkg recipies

These are my personal AutoPkg recipes.

The Draw.io one replaces the currently broken one at - https://github.com/autopkg/peshay-recipes/tree/master/drawio it lacks a valid munki recipe.

The Rocket.Chat+ desktop client is a new one since there was no existing one I could find.

The Gifox one is for the GIF tool, there seems to only be a partial one of this for JSS, mine is a full one for Munki. 

The libmacgpg-free one downloads a replacement library for GPGSuite and then wraps it in an installer package to restore 'free' functionality.
