This recipe is now deprecated

When I originally created these recipes Zoom did not provide a universal binary version of their app and it was necessary to individually download either the Intel or Apple Silion installer packages.

Fortunately they have since released a universal binary installler and Matt Hansen has created an AutoPkg download recipe for this which are available at https://github.com/autopkg/hansen-m-recipes/tree/master/Zoom

I have therefore myself switched to using this alternative recipe and do not plan to update my own ones. I will leave them available here should anyone currently be using them or prefer using individual Intel and Apple Silicon choices instead of a Universal one.
