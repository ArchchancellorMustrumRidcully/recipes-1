# Info

pinpoint is a script that is able to find the location of your Mac using Google's GeoLocation APIs. In order to use Google's GeoLocation APIs you need to obtain an API key. As of July 16th 2018 you also need to enable billing on your account for your API key aka Project. As far as I can see you get a $200 per month credit and this should be enough for 10,000 uses of Geolocation, Geocoding and Elevation APIs _each_. See [Pinpoint](https://github.com/jelockwood/pinpoint/wiki).
